  <h2 align="center">Possibilities of scripts</h2>

  <p align="center">
    We have have seen a lot of people talk about how we should make something that is more than adding 500+ tokens.<br>
 We can not do that due to the blooket api making it <b>max tokens</b>. It might seem a bit weird due to us being able to give you guys access to a script that gives you 500 tokens, so you would think we could make one that gives you more. But we cannot.<br>
    There are some things you can't change without owning that website or having access to the database of the website.<br>
    Please keep this in mind. Thank you a lot for the support.<br>
    <br>
    There are ones that alot of people ask for like: Unban, All blooks forever, more than 500+ tokens, etc. We can not do any of that.
